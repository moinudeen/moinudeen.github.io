#  I am Syed Moinudeen. 
You can call me **Syed** or you can call me as **Symo**, just like most of my friends and colleagues :)
I am an aspiring computer scientist who loves building/tinkering intelligent systems. You can know more about me [here](https://moinudeen.github.io/about/).

Wanted to start writing my own blog for a long time now. Finally I have a blog site, up and running. I would like to share my thoughts primarily on Computers, Math, ML and AI systems. Would also be sharing my experiments and ideas here :)

Hopefully I will start posting here soon.

## Stay tuned!
