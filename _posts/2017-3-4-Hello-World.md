### I am SYed MOinudeen.
An aspiring computer scientist who loves building/tinkering intelligent systems. 

Wanted to start writing my own blog for a long time now. Finally I have a blog site, up and running. I would like to share my thoughts primarily on Computers, Math, ML and AI systems. Would also be sharing my experiments and ideas here :)

Hopefully I will start posting here soon.

## Stay tuned!
