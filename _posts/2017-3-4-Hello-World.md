I am 
# SYed MOinudeen, 
an aspiring computer scientist. My interests lie in building/tinkering intelligent systems. 

Wanted to start writing my own blog for a long time now, Finally I have a blog site up and running. I would like to share my thoughts primarily on Computers, Math, ML and AI systems. Would also be sharing my experiments and ideas here. :)

Hopefully I will start my posting here soon. 

## Stay tuned!
